For Task 1, I developed the Price Gap Pair Finder algorithm independently without using any AI prompts. I implemented the O(n) solution using hashing to find pairs with the specified difference and handled all edge cases including lexicographical ordering, duplicates with k=0, and empty list scenarios through my own problem-solving approach.

For Task 2's FastAPI development, I used AI prompts to design the REST API structure, specifically requesting help with "creating FastAPI routes with proper Pydantic models for request/response validation" and "implementing error handling for external Movie Database API calls with retry logic." I also sought assistance with "Python 3.9 compatibility fixes for type hints and imports" to ensure the web service would run smoothly.

For Task 3's W-2 Parser, I heavily relied on AI prompts to craft specialized Gemini AI instructions, including "extraction prompts to convert W-2 forms into structured JSON" and "insight generation prompts for tax analysis and validation." I also used technical prompts for "OCR integration with PDF and image processing" and "sensitive data masking for SSN and EIN information" to create a comprehensive AI-powered document processing system.
